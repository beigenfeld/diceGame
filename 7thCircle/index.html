		<p>You have been punished by the gods, and cast into the center of the Seven Circles of Hell!  To escape the underworld, you must get through the six gates between each circle, and make it through the door back to the land of the living.  Start by rolling the four-sided die to open the first gate.  Don't be fooled by the ease of passing the first gate!  Each succesive gate is locked by the next-highest number sided die, and you must match or exceed the value of your previous roll in order to pass!
